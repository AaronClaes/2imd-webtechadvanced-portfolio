# Lab 5 - nodejs

[API test on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/aaron-claes/pen/jOVoBNe)

Heroku does not allow it to deploy a nodejs project that is not in the root directory of the repository. That's why I was forced to copy the code in a new repo and add some minor changes to make it work with Heroku.
